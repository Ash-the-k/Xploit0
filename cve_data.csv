firmware: cs_dsp: Fix overflow checking of wmfw header

Fix the checking that firmware file buffer is large enough for the
wmfw header, to prevent overrunning the buffer.

The original code tested that the firmware data buffer contained
enough bytes for the sums of the size of the structs

	wmfw_header + wmfw_adsp1_sizes + wmfw_footer

But wmfw_adsp1_sizes is only used on ADSP1 firmware. For ADSP2 and
Halo Core the equivalent struct is wmfw_adsp2_sizes, which is
4 bytes longer. So the length check didn't guarantee that there
are enough bytes in the firmware buffer for a header with
wmfw_adsp2_sizes.

This patch splits the length check into three separate parts. Each
of the wmfw_header, wmfw_adsp?_sizes and wmfw_footer are checked
separately before they are used.",7.8,HIGH

It is an is an independently maintained version of Flask-Security based on the 3.0.0 version of Flask-Security. All versions of Flask-Security-Too allow redirects after many successful views (e.g. /login) by honoring the ?next query param. There is code in FS to validate that the url specified in the next parameter is either relative OR has the same netloc (network location) as the requesting URL. This check utilizes Pythons urlsplit library. However many browsers are very lenient on the kind of URL they accept and 'fill in the blanks' when presented with a possibly incomplete URL. As a concrete example - setting http://login?next=\\\github.com will pass FS's relative URL check however many browsers will gladly convert this to http://github.com. Thus an attacker could send such a link to an unwitting user, using a legitimate site and have it redirect to whatever site they want. This is considered a low severity due to the fact that if Werkzeug is used (which is very common with Flask applications) as the WSGI layer, it by default ALWAYS ensures that the Location header is absolute - thus making this attack vector mute.
